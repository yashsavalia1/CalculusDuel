# Calculus Duel

This game tests your Calculus knowledge in fun duels while playing as historic mathematicians. It was my final project for my Calculus class.

## How it was Made

The game was made entirely using the Java Swing API while the quesitons were generated using the Maven library [jlatexmath](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.scilab.forge/jlatexmath/1.0.7/jar).

Note that the game may get flagged as a virus (Sorry there is not much I can do on this front).
